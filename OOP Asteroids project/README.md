This project simulates space missions where rockets are assigned to mine asteroids and sell extracted resources on a market. The program reads data from input files, processes missions based on efficiency, and outputs multiple result reports. Object-oriented programming principles are used throughout the implementation (constructors, destructors, getters, setters, encapsulation, etc.).

For the asteroids, rockets, and market, I created a separate class for each, each containing a constructor, destructor, getters, and setters. Every class has both a .h header file and a .cpp implementation file.
I also created missions. For that, I implemented a Missions class that includes a constructor, destructor, getters, and setters as well.
Data reading was implemented using the find() function. I searched for the ";" character, then read from position 0 up to the ";" delimiter, and removed what had already been processed from the current line.
In the createMissions function, I generated the missions and selected the most efficient rocket for each one. However, I was not able to make a rocket mine two different resources simultaneously (when separated by "&"). The function calculates the extracted quantity, the fuel consumption, total fuel cost, and both gross and net profit.
There are also additional functions that write results to output files and compute different statistics (efficiency score, sorting rockets by net profit in descending order, etc.).
