# Zebra Hack Project

This repository contains the work done by team `Marian` for ZebraHack2.0, the hackathon organized for the Web Technologies course at ACS in UPB.

>> During the hackathon, our team developed a modern and responsive web platform concept for Alumil, a company specialized in aluminum systems and construction solutions.
Our goal was to design a user-friendly interface that improves interaction between clients, management, and the production team.

 >> Objectives
Improve communication and transparency between the company and its partners.
Create a digital interface that centralizes reports, contact forms, dashboards, and company information.
Provide a scalable and clean UI/UX foundation for further development.
